# AnomalyDetection
This repository is used for anomaly detection software created by Mindaugas Berei≈°a on Python. For farther use You have to get my permission.
It can be used in two ways:
# On Pycharm: 
to run and look for anomalies in lardge MS Access files and cut in smaller intervals to directories with copied Jupyter Notebooks.
Notebooks will be made to be ready to rerun automatically with new data in the folder.
# On Jupyter Notebook only:
You need to use files outside of folder by using "data_zero.csv" file. 
For more detailed information please contact me.
